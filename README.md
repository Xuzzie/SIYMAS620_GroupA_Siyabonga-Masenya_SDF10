## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

An API is a piece of software  that allows different software to communicate  with each other. It's vital for different systems both within a piece of software and outside of it  work together smoothly. An example provided in a previous lecture is the payment system within the Uber app. The payment system in the Uber app is an API.

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 
An interface is the functional facade of a piece of software in the end user uses to affect the running of the software. For example, the dial on a radio is part of its interface. An API on the other hand is the internal components within the software that are tasked with communicating with each other in order to complete a predefined task.


3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

 APIs have different  components such as endpoints, methods,  and data formats (JSON, XML) . My favorite API mentioned is that of Web API's . The reason for this is that open-source  Web APIs  work in real time to provide updated information that can be used in interesting ways. An example of this is Spotify allowing developers to use their house APIS for web developers to make innovative  music web apps 

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

I have used the Curl API with homebrew to interact with APIS on the web. I found this experience easier than I thought and therefore had a good experience using it 

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

I feel good about understanding how APIs work theoretically. But I'm still not confident in their use since u still require much improvement on my basic CSS and Javascript . Therefore I need to improve my basics since if I do that I will improve my capacities with APIs
